# Frontend (Planned) – LLM Analytics Dictionary & SQL Assistant

This folder represents the planned React-based frontend for the project.

Planned features:
- Search bar to look up business metrics from the analytics dictionary
- Text box to enter plain-English analytics questions
- Display generated SQL queries from the backend
- Copy-to-clipboard button for analysts and engineers

A simple React app can be wired to the FastAPI backend exposed in `backend/main.py`.
